It is surronded for about a mile in all directions by flooded diggings and structures built over melenia as peopleof various races have tried to determine just what the heck it is; the whole area is therefore reminiscent of the Somme battlefieds of 1916.

Many passages branch off the shaft, twisting and turning either up to the surface or down to the depths.

20,11,,2011,Mountains,,,Gus L.,"Mooncalf, a potent monsterous sorcerer from the moon has holed up in an old tomb carved into the side of this imposingly bare mountain.  Mooncalf appears as a centuar like figure with a lower body of dappled pale fungus and eyes that glow with white fire.  He has been sent by the masters of the moon to reactivate an ancient army of moon men (now the unsuspecting residents of [[Angleae]]) to continue a war of spite and destruction.  Mooncalf knows the correct order of glyphs to activate the [[Baleful Sign]] and will do so to destory [[Angleae]] and its people if he discovers them in thier degenerate state.  He is pained by gravity, depressed at being forever exiled from his home, and confused by the profusion of life on the terrestial sphere.  Mooncalf will trade sorcerous knowledge and euphoria producing moon fungus, golden pearls and starstuff for information on the wereabout of the [[Baleful Sign]], captive locals to interrogate or allies to do his masters' spiteful bidding.

A moderate DC search or perception check will reveal that the canopy above is unbroken and clear tracks through the cypress roots show that a large group of humanoids battled it from deeper in the swamp to here. Following the tracks will lead to a group of dragonslayers (random NPC adventuring party) looting the dragon's nest. They are injured and many of their spells are expended from the fight. They will be cautious and will fight to protect their loot but will flee obviously more powerful parties. If they flee, they will follow to reclaim their loot at the most opportune time.

The apothecaries efforts to treat citizens in the castle failed, but sustaining herself with stong stimulants (there are several vials of foul smelling powder in the pack) she managed to fend of sleep for some weeks.  The writing shows signs of maddness toward the journal's end, but the apothecary came to the conclusion that [[Aeravir Castle]] was cursed and that the sleeping sickness was regional rather then a disease - she aparently failed to make it far enough out of town before falling asleep.",http://dungeonofsigns.blogspot.com/,,Aeravir Castle
